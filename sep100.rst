Overview
--------
At SciPy 2012, there was a lot of discussion around how to 
legitimize and formalize our activities - especially in the 
eyes of funding agencies.  One mechanism to prove our value, 
to computational science would be to have a visible, searchable 
database of citations.  This would include papers that discuss: 

* Science applications which use Python,
* General purpose packages (NumPy, SciPy, IPython, etc.),
* Domain specific packages, 
* and new methods primarily implemented in any of the above.

Proposal
--------
This proposal aims to develop two resources:

* A ``scipy.bib`` file,
* A web interface to this file. 

The ``scipy.bib`` file would be a normal bibtex file hosted on GitHub.
This file would then be able to be added to by the community via the
pull request mechanism.  Individuals publishing with Python could then 
uses this citations file as a reference for their own publications.  They
would also be asked to submit their articles back to this file for 
posterity.

The web interface to this file would likely be hosted at http://numfocus.org/.
It should be a searchable page similar to the 
`FLASH publication list <http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/publications/flash_pubs.shtml>`_.
This will provide an easy place to refer potential funders to.
